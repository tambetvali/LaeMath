# Laegna calculators

- [Octave Calculator](https://accelerative-complex-6gs6.bolt.host/) takes care of advanced integration order calculation, the "octave" of projection and it's outcome
  (i.e. difference of z and x, x and r - the projector and projective object into projective space).
- [Frequency Calculator](https://3oumxxajlfzw2.mocha.app/) while the numbers have no octaves, if they are R space the imaginary part is 0, cancelled out, and the real
  part is r - the real number. Now, while infinity cannot be reached, limit value avoids all accelerated points; still, the octaves and frequencies of classic music
  theory, magic numbers which repeat light frequency patterns into orders of two and create "c^2" as equivalent space to infinite distance in "e"; all these rules
  come into play with pythagorean harmonies of comparability and clocktickwerk of calculus with harmonious numbers, and the "strange harmonies" that octaves in expanding
  units and random symmetries still give digit series for particular numbers, which keep all relations: altough, they now exist is strange, metaphor realms, higher
  Hilbert spaces where you cannot associate the digits with "anything in particular, local relations" - it's like "spirit" and "matter", where human's goal-based spirit
  is either not so material; or then the material is something more than cause and effect.

of basic math is the harmonic union of the two, and all the other theoretic basis which is always simplified to basic Laegna math models and basic letter math.
